
-d	With this option, more will prompt the user with the message "[Press space to continue, 'q' to quit.]" and display "[Press 'h' for instructions.]" when an illegal key is pressed, instead of ringing a bell.

-f	Causes more to count logical, rather than screen lines (i.e., long lines are not wrapped).

-l	more usually treats ^L (CONTROL-L, the form feed) as a special character, and will pause after any line that contains it. The -l option will prevent this behavior.

-p	Do not scroll. Instead, clear the whole screen and then display the text. This option is switched on automatically if the more executable is named page.

-c	Do not scroll. Instead, paint each screen from the top, clearing the remainder of each line as it is displayed.

-s	Squeeze multiple blank lines into one blank line.

-u	Do not display underlines.

-num 	Sets the number of lines that makes up a screenful. The lines must be an integer.

+num	Start displaying text at line number num.

+/string	Search for the string string, and advance to the first line containing string when the file is displayed.
